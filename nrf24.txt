VCC
recommend 3.3V

GND

CE=binary input
Transmitter low except when transimtting
Reciever high to monitor, low to not monitor

CSN=SS
High except when recivening data on the SPI bus or sending SPI commands
Low throught entire transaction

SCK=SCK

MOSI=SDO/SPI data out
microcontroller send data to radio

MISO=SDI/SPI data in
radio send data to microcontroller

IRQ=binary input
ACTIVE-LOW
High normally, low when interrupt is asserted
The Data Ready interrupt is set by a new packet arrival event. The procedure for handling this
interrupt should be: 1) read payload via SPI, 2) clear RX_DR interrupt, 3) read FIFO_STATUS to
check if there are more payloads available in RX FIFO, 4) if there are more data in RX FIFO, repeat
from 1). 

SPI 
setup as 8bit data transfer
setup spi port as master
max 8-10Mbps
PIC is 200 ns instruction cycle, so no need to worry about SPI related timings as they are mostly below 50 nss

On recieve
CE is high, set to low to disable reciver
execute R_RX_PAYLOAD
send command byte (0x61)
send dummy bytes for how many you want to read
24L01 will delete the payload you read from FIFO
read all payloads in FIFO can contain 3
CE to high

To transmit, INFO can load 3 packets into TX_FIFO like RX_FIFO can contain 3, this will transmit them all
Send command (0xA0)
send the payload, must match reciever payload length
toggle CE to high for at least 10 us
if sent TX_DS interrupt will occur
if max retries happen MAX_RT will occour

FLUSH_TX and FLUSH_RX can flush registers

registers

register 00 is config
PWR_UP bit set to do anything with device
PRIM_RX set is reciever, cleared is transmitter
CRC hash to check if data is corrupted, is auto in shockburst

register 01 EN_AA
allows to enable auto acknowedgement for each pipe/connection, 
recieve adress must bbeb the same as transmit adress if this feature is used
will assert MAX_RT interrupt if not actknowledged

register 02 EN_RXADDR
to enable any pipe write 1

register 03 SETUP_AW
MUST set adress 3-5 adress bytes, match both reciever and transmitter, the bigger adress fewer wrong packets

register 04 SETUP_RETR
alllows to change time delay and attemps after failed EN_AA

register 05 RF_CH
allows to choose frequency
frequency allowed in denmark 2400mhz to 2500mhz 
nrf24l01 frequency 2400mhz to 2525mhz
100/(125/128)=102.4, meaning that frequency choice 101 and under should be allowed

register 06 RF_SETUP
PLL_LOCK and LNA_HCURR should not be changed
RF_DR allows to change speed 1mbps or 2mbps
RF_PWR changes power used, recommended highest value

register 07 STATUS
used when IRQ goes low
RX_DR data ready, write bit to 1 to clear
TX_DS data sent, write bit to 1 to clear
MAX_RT max retry, write bit to 1 to clear
TX_FULL gives if TX_FIFO is full
RX_P_NO gives data pipe for the recieved payload

register 08 OBSERVE_TX
PLOS_CNT counter of lost packets max 15, reset by changin RF_CH/frequency
ARC_CNT no idea

register 09 cd
monitor if there is anything on any RF channel, not usefull

register 0(A-F) RX_ADDR_P(0-5)
does something

register 10 TX_ADDR
transmit adress used for PTX device ony

register 11-16 PX_PW_P(0-5)
number of bytes in RX payload 1-32

register 17 FIFO_STATUS
TX_REUSE resend on repeat
TX_FULL, TX_EMPTY, RX_FULL, RX_EMPTY makes senses

9 more bytes send on enhanced shockburst
