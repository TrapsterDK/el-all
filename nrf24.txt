VCC
recommend 3.3V

GND

CE input
Transmitter low except when transimtting
Recoever high to monitor, low to not monitor

CSN=SS
High except when recivening data on the SPI bus or sending SPI commands
Low throught entire transaction

SCK=SCK

MOSI=SDO/SPI data out
microcontroller send data to radio

MISO=SDI/SPI data in
radio send data to microcontroller

IRQ input
ACTIVE-LOW
High normally, low when interrupt is asserted
The Data Ready interrupt is set by a new packet arrival event. The procedure for handling this
interrupt should be: 1) read payload via SPI, 2) clear RX_DR interrupt, 3) read FIFO_STATUS to
check if there are more payloads available in RX FIFO, 4) if there are more data in RX FIFO, repeat
from 1). 

SPI max 8-10Mbps

On recieve
CE is high, set to low to disable reciver
execute R_RX_PAYLOAD
send command byte (0x61)
send dummy bytes for how many you want to read
24L01 will delete the payload you read from FIFO
read all payloads in FIFO can contain 3
CE to high

To transmit, INFO can load 3 packets into TX_FIFO like RX_FIFO can contain 3, this will transmit them all
Send command (0xA0)
send the payload, must match reciever payload length
toggle CE to high for at least 10 us
if sent TX_DS interrupt will occur
if max retries happen MAX_RT will occour

FLUSH_TX and FLUSH_RX can flush registers
